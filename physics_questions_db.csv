Particle Physics,Particle Physics,1,In 1905 Einstein published his equation for the photoelectric effect In 1916 Millikan demonstrated that the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is consistent with Einstein's equation Millikan's experiments involved using different frequencies of light These were obtained using a mercury vapour lamp which produced an emission spectrum with a specific number of known frequencies The diagram shows some energy levels for a mercury atom — 0eV — —1356eV — —157eV — —248eV — —371eV Not to — —495eV scale — —532eV — —574eV — —1038eV Determine which transition from the -371 eV energy level would produce light of wavelength 61 x 107m (Total for question = 4 marks) Particle Nature of Light and The Wave-Particle Duality,"Question mee ae A = Number Acceptable answers Additional guidance Mark Example of calculation 7 * Use of E=hf Q) | f=30010°ms!/61* 107m Useofe=p, = 491 x 10"" Hz : (1) | E=663* 19"" I s* 491 x 10"" Hz Apply conversion factor of 16 =326x 10J 5 x 107” for photon energy from 326 * 10° /16*10%C=204eV TtoeV (1) | Level =-371 eV - 204 eV=-575 eV * Level =-574 (eV) qd) 4"
