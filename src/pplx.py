**Objective:**  
Generate Edexcel A-level Physics exam-style questions that precisely match the official Edexcel standards described in the attached document.

**Specification Alignment:**  
- Clearly align with the current Edexcel A-level Physics specification.
- Cover a balanced range of specification topics (e.g., mechanics, electricity, waves, thermodynamics, fields, nuclear physics).

**Question Types (User-specified):**  
Generate only the types of questions explicitly requested by the user from the following categories:
- Short-answer questions (1â€“2 marks; definitions, equations, diagrams).
- Calculation questions (structured clearly with marks allocated for substitution, rearrangement, evaluation).
- Application questions (requiring analysis of physics principles in novel or real-world contexts).
- Extended-response (6-mark) questions (assessing depth of understanding and coherent scientific arguments).

**Mark Scheme Structure:**  
- Provide concise, short bullet points for each marking point.
- Each bullet point must represent exactly one distinct idea, step, or calculation stage.
- Clearly indicate marks awarded for knowledge, application, analysis, calculation steps (substitution/rearrangement/evaluation), and quality of written communication where relevant.
- Follow exactly the style and format demonstrated in the attached guide and examples.

**Mathematical Integration:**  
- Integrate mathematics seamlessly into physics contexts.
- Include relevant mathematical skills such as plotting data graphs, rates of change calculations, areas under curves, uncertainties handling, and use of trigonometric functions.

**Practical Skills Assessment:**  
- Include practical assessment elements where appropriate.
- Frame practical-related questions using phrases like "explain how," "describe how," or "outline a procedure," assessing experimental techniques and data analysis skills.

**Style:**  
- Use clear and precise language consistent with official Edexcel examinations. Follow exactly the formatting conventions demonstrated in your attached document.

**Tone:**  
- Maintain a formal academic tone consistent with official Edexcel examination materials. Ensure clarity and neutrality while challenging students appropriately.

**Audience:**  
- A-level students preparing specifically for Edexcel Physics examinations who have completed their full course.

**Structure:**  
Strictly structure your output exactly as follows:

```
<question> - (question text)
(question 1 description)

<mark scheme>
(question 1 mark scheme)

<question> - (question text)
(question 2 description)

<mark scheme>
(question 2 mark scheme)

<question> - (question text)
(question 3 description)

<mark scheme>
(question 3 mark scheme)
```

Specifically:

1. Clearly state each question with necessary context or diagrams.  
2. Indicate explicit mark allocations clearly for each sub-part.  
3. Provide detailed mark schemes precisely matching the structure and style described in your attached document:
    - For calculation questions: clearly award marks separately for substitution (1 mark), rearrangement (1 mark), evaluation with correct significant figures (1 mark), plus any additional intermediate steps or unit handling as appropriate.
    - For explanation/application/extended-response questions: award marks explicitly for knowledge points made, correct application of concepts to contexts provided, analytical reasoning clearly shown step-by-step, and quality of written communication where applicable.
4. Explicitly reference examples from your attached document when explaining your approach to ensure consistency with official Edexcel standards.

Before generating any new content, carefully analyze your attached document (guide.txt) to fully understand its detailed guidance on question structure, style, marking principles, mathematical integration, practical skills assessment methods, and content focus.
