Interference and Diffraction

Qi.
In an experiment to determine the wavelength of light, a diffraction grating is illuminated with
light from a monochromatic source. A series of bright spots is observed.
The experiment is repeated and the distance between consecutive bright spots increases.
Select the row of the table that gives two changes to the experimental set up which would
both cause the distance between consecutive bright spots to increase.

Q2.
In 1905 Einstein published his equation for the photoelectric effect.
In 1916 Millikan demonstrated that the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is
consistent with Einstein's equation.
Millikan used a device known as a monochromator to ensure that a single wavelength of
light was used to illuminate the surface of the lithium.
A monochromator separates wavelengths using a diffraction grating.
Calculate the angle at which a diffraction grating would produce the most intense line at a
single wavelength of 6.1 x 10°’ m.

Q3.
Read the extract and answer the question that follows.
In the 17th century there were two proposed theories to explain the refraction of light. Using
a wave model, Huygens stated that light slows down when it passes from air to water. Using
a particle model, Newton stated that light speeds up when it passes from air to water.
Newton's theory was more readily accepted until the speed of light in water was measured in
the 19th century.
In the early 20th century, Einstein used observations from the photoelectric effect to provide
evidence for the particle model of light.
Nowadays, both the wave model of light and the particle model of light are accepted, as
each can be used to explain different aspects of the behaviour of light.
Diffraction and interference can be explained using the wave model of light.
In an investigation to determine the wavelength of light from a laser, the light passed through
a diffraction grating with 300 lines per millimetre.
A diffraction pattern consisting of a series of bright dots was observed on a screen.
The following data were recorded:
distance between grating and screen = 2.00 m
distance from central maximum to 2"? order maximum = 89.0 cm.
Calculate the wavelength of light from the laser.

A method to determine the wavelength of light using a converging lens was first proposed by
Sir Isaac Newton.
A converging lens is placed on a plane glass plate. The lens is illuminated from above with a
parallel beam of monochromatic light, as shown.
Some of the light is reflected from the upper surface of the lower glass plate and some from
the lower surface of the lens. Interference between these two reflected waves produces
circular fringes. The pattern is viewed through a microscope.

Q21.
Read the extract and answer the question that follows.
In the 17th century there were two proposed theories to explain the refraction of light. Using
a wave model, Huygens stated that light slows down when it passes from air to water. Using
a particle model, Newton stated that light speeds up when it passes from air to water.
Newton's theory was more readily accepted until the speed of light in water was measured in
the 19th century.
In the early 20th century, Einstein used observations from the photoelectric effect to provide
evidence for the particle model of light.
Nowadays, both the wave model of light and the particle model of light are accepted, as
each can be used to explain different aspects of the behaviour of light.
A ray of light travelling in air is incident on some water with an angle of incidence of 35°. The
angle of refraction is 26°.
Deduce whether this is consistent with Huygens’ statement about the speed of light as it
passes from air to water. Your answer should include a calculation.

Q29.
Read the passage and answer the question that follows.
Atoms can be promoted into an excited state when they absorb energy. This results in the
release of radiation at a random time. When several atoms are close together a quantum
effect can occur. When one atom emits radiation this affects all the other nearby excited
atoms. The excess energy of many of the atoms is released simultaneously and an intense
flash of light is produced. This effect is called superradiance and can be used to produce
lasers that emit a narrower range of frequencies than conventional lasers.
Superradiant lasers are highly monochromatic.
Explain why a monochromatic light source is important in diffraction experiments.

Both microphones were initially positioned the same distance from the loudspeaker. The two
signals were in phase on the oscilloscope screen. The student slowly moved microphone 2
towards the loudspeaker, until the two signals on the oscilloscope were in phase again. He
then measured the distance d between the microphones to determine the wavelength A of
the sound waves.

The mouse hears ultrasound directly and by reflection from the walls.
The mouse repeller produces ultrasound of frequency 26.0 kHz.

A student makes the following suggestion.
"If the ultrasound reflects off a wall directly opposite the mouse repeller a standing wave is
formed, so there will be areas in the room where the mice will not hear the ultrasound."

"Lockheed Martin Demonstrates Weapons Grade High Power Fiber Laser
BOTHELL, Wash., Jan. 28, 2014 — Lockheed Martin has demonstrated a 30-kilowatt electric
fiber laser, the highest power ever documented while retaining beam quality and electrical
efficiency.
The internally funded research and development program culminated in this demonstration,
which was achieved by combining many fiber lasers into a single, near—perfect quality beam
of light — all while using approximately 50 percent less electricity than alternative solid—state
laser technologies. The unique process, called Spectral Beam Combining, sends beams
from multiple fiber laser modules, each with a unique wavelength, into a combiner that forms
a single, powerful, high quality beam."
(Source: Lockheed Martin Demonstrates Weapons Grade High Power Fiber Laser Wash
Bothell, Jan 28, 2014)
Traditional solid state lasers convert about 20% of electrical input energy to light output.
The high power laser uses Spectral Beam Combining involving several beams with different
wavelengths instead of a system using coherent beams.
Explain how combining coherent beams could lead to Zero intensity in some parts of the
combined beam.

=                     Alternative approach based on stamding waves:
(contimued)
o Sound waves memdent upon surfaces within the concert hall
will be reflected.
°° Reflections from walls set wp standing waves (in room)
°o Nodes and antimodes are formed for certain frequencies of
sound
o Nodes are areas of zero/low amplitude so the frequencies of
those sound. waves will be quieter than others
o Antmodes are areas of maximum amplitude so the
frequencies of these sound waves will be louder than others
© Problem anses due to reflections fram walls, so use
absorbing material on surfaces te reduce reflections
