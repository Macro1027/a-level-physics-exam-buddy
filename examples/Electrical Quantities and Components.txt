Q24.
Conducting putty is a material that is a relatively good conductor and can be easily moulded
into different shapes.
A student decides to investigate how the resistance R of a cylinder of conducting putty
depends upon the cross-sectional area A of the cylinder.
(a) She sets up the circuit shown and keeps the length / of the cylinder constant at 7.5 cm.
She uses the ammeter and voltmeter readings to determine the resistance of cylinders of
different cross-sectional areas.

A solar panel uses electromagnetic radiation from the Sun to generate electricity.
In one installation a sensor in the solar panel measures the intensity of radiation arriving
from different directions. A motor rotates the solar panel so that it always faces the brightest
part of the sky.
The circuit diagram shows how a light dependent resistor (LDR) can be used to produce an
output potential difference (p.d.) that is dependent on the intensity of light. This output p.d. is
connected to a motor circuit that operates the movement of the solar panel.

Q40.
Filament and fluorescent are two types of light bulb.
Filament light bulbs contain a tightly coiled wire filament, surrounded by an inert gas and
encased in a thin glass bulb. When the potential difference (p.d.) across the bulb is
sufficient, the filament heats up, emitting visible light.
Fluorescent light bulbs use a long tube of glass containing a small amount of mercury. When
a sufficient p.d. is applied across the ends of the tube, electrons moving through the tube
cause the mercury to become a vapour and emit photons in the ultraviolet part of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The collisions of these photons with the phosphor coating of the
tube result in the emission of photons of visible light.

(ii) Filament bulbs are designed to last for thousands of hours of use. Over time the filament
may wear away, becoming thinner at one point. This can cause the filament to melt and
break at that point.

Assess whether the filament is more likely to break as the bulb is switched on or when it
