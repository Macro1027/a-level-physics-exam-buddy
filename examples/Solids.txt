Q5.
In a conical spring the diameter of the coils increases over its length. The spring can be
designed so that each coil fits into the inner diameter of the next coil so they take up minimal
space when fully compressed.
(Source: © Anatoli Riabokon/Alamy Stock Vector)
A conical spring is compressed against a flat surface. The graph shows the force-
displacement graph for the spring as the compression force increases from 0 N to the point
when the spring is fully compressed.

Spiders are almost completely dependent on vibrations transmitted through their web for
receiving information about the location of trapped insects. When the threads are disturbed
by the insects, progressive waves are transmitted along sections of the silk.
It has been suggested that the droplets of water collect at certain points on the web because
stationary waves are formed.
The diagram shows water droplets on a single thread of spider silk when the frequency of
waves is 7.9 Hz.

Q14.
Read the following article and then answer the questions that follow.

"The fastest, tallest and longest dive coaster, on which amusement park thrill seekers
can experience free fall, is set to open next summer at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio.
Valravn is designed to take riders up to a 66 m peak from which they plummet vertically
with an acceleration g and feel weightless.
The advent of steel-frame roller coasters in 1959 made taller structures possible.
Whereas height remains one of the best ways to attain intense speeds, a coaster car
can also be shot from its starting point via electromagnetic propulsion or a catapult.
Cars on these launched coasters have the potential to go from zero to 130 kmh“ in
two seconds.
Although coasters can definitely go faster, they're limited by the acceleration those
higher speeds would require. Roller coasters reach their peak speeds in a matter of
seconds. The achieved acceleration is what causes g-forces, which allows riders to feel
an increased or decreased sense of their mass. These g-forces can be dangerous but
they are also well understood by physicists, so roller coasters are built according to
strict standards that keep them well within safe levels.
Coasters are only permitted to accelerate up to 6g."

o Unpolarised white light passes through the lower polarising filter and becomes plane
polarised.

o When there is no potential difference (p.d.) across the liquid crystal, the molecules in
the liquid crystal rotate the plane of polarisation by 90°.

o Light then passes through the upper polarising filter and appears on the screen.

o When a p.d. is applied across the liquid crystal, the molecules no longer rotate the
plane of polarisation. The light will not pass through the upper polarising filter and the
screen appears dark.

Manufacturers are developing new materials for flexible screens for liquid-crystal displays.
The graph shows how stress varies with strain for two materials X and Y up to typical
stresses that would be applied to the screens in normal use. Both materials behave

(ref: Physics Review April 2015 p22)
The Charpy test is used by scientists to measure the fracture toughness of a material. A
simple pendulum, with a hammer on the end, is held high and released so that it swings
down and strikes the sample. The height from which the hammer is released is increased
until the sample fractures. Some energy is absorbed by the sample in the impact but the
hammer continues to move until it comes to rest at the top of its swing. Due to the law of
conservation of energy the hammer will not swing up as high as its starting position. The
difference in height between the start and end is proportional to the energy absorbed in the
impact — the fracture toughness.

rule clamped with a free length L.

Young modulus E of the material of the metre rule by the following equation:
where K is a constant.

The metre rules have identical dimensions, but are made from different types of wood.

with an electronic stopwatch. This is repeated twice with the same metre rule. The same
procedure is carried out for the second metre rule, using an identical mass and free length.

would help the student to obtain repeatable data.

In a conical spring the diameter of the coils increases over its length. The spring can be
designed so that each coil fits into the inner diameter of the next coil so they take up minimal
space when fully compressed.

A conical spring is compressed against a flat surface. The graph shows the force-
displacement graph for the spring as the compression force increases from 0 N to the point
when the spring is fully compressed.
