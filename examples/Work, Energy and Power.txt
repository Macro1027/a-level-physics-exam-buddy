The Solar Impulse 2 is a solar-powered plane that completed a round the world trip in 2016
without using fossil fuels.

The wings are covered in thin solar panels, keeping the total mass of the plane and pilot at
1600 kg. The need to reduce the weight limits the efficiency of the solar panels to 23%.
However, in daylight, these panels generate enough energy to run the four 7.5 kW electric
motors that keep the plane airborne and to fully charge the batteries that power the plane
during the night. The batteries take about 6 hours to fully charge.

In daylight the plane flies at a height of 8500 m to harness the most sunlight, and at night
descends to 1500 m. This descent makes use of the gravitational potential energy gained
during the day to help the plane get through the night.

(Source: www.solarimpulse.com)

The plane flies at the greater height during the day. At night it glides down to the lower
height over a period of 4 hours, with the motors switched off.
Calculate the change in gravitational potential energy as the plane glides down.

Read the extract and answer the question that follows.
Gravitricity is developing a new technology to capture and store the excess power generated
by renewable energy resources. A large load is suspended by cables in a disused mineshaft.
During periods of low power demand, excess generated power is used to winch the load
upwards. During periods of high demand, the load is lowered down the shaft, causing
electricity to be generated. The system can produce electricity at low power for several
hours, or a short burst of electricity at high power.
(Source based on: https://gravitricity.com/)
One such system is planned to use a load of mass 2500 tonnes. The load will be at the top
of a shaft. The load will be lowered down the shaft at a steady speed. A useful power output
of 15 MW will be generated. The system will have an efficiency of 80%.

The student wrote the following conclusion:
“The greater the drop height, the greater the diameter of The crater
formed when a sphere hits the sand. This is because the impact velocity
increases as the drop height is increased. As the speed of the sphere
increases The diameter of the crater formed also increases. Also, the
bigger the sphere the bigger the crater."

Q32.
A projectile of mass 65 g is fired vertically upwards into a stationary wooden block of mass
2.400 kg, as shown.
-  _~ wooden block
a | projectile
The projectile becomes embedded in the block. They both move vertically upwards through
a vertical displacement of 55 cm before momentarily coming to rest.
Calculate the energy dissipated as the projectile hits the block.

(a) The student wants to determine the mass of one of the rubber bands. He places five
rubber bands on a balance and obtains a reading of 2 g. He divides the reading on
the balance by five to determine the mass of one rubber band.
Explain how he could improve his result.
(3)
(6) The rubber band is stretched by 17.4 cm when it is placed on the toy.
Show that the work done on the rubber band is about 1 J.

(d) The student thinks the calculated value of maximum velocity is too high because the
band does not travel as far as expected.
Explain how the student could determine the initial velocity with the use of a video
camera and why light gates would not be suitable.

The rock is held in a sling. When the peg is removed the counterweight falls and the rock is
projected through the air.
The mass of the counterweight was reduced. The trebuchet was then used to project the
rock again.
Explain why the horizontal distance travelled by the rock decreases.
