On the diagram, the position of the main biting muscle is indicated by the line labelled
muscle force’. The muscle is connected to the jaw at point J. This produces a moment about
point P where the jaw is hinged. Teeth marks found in fossilised Triceratops bones show that
the force exerted by a tooth at the front of the jaw X could reach 6500 N.
The skull is drawn to a scale of 1 to 10. The force arrows are not drawn to scale.
Take measurements from the diagram to determine the size of the muscle force when the
force exerted by the tooth at X is 6500 N.

The steam cylinder rod exerts a force 7 on the beam. The force exerted on the beam by the
pump rod can be neglected.

equal to the moment of

© reference to taking
moments about the

be implied in response)
o If @ is large enough,
centre of gravity (of

ladder.
°» moment of weight is now

°o Mo anticlockwise moments
Or Zclockwise moments>
Zanticlockwise moments
(so ladder will topple)
