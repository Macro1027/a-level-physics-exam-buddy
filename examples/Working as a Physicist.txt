A student investigated how the volume of a fixed mass of air varies with the temperature of
the air. She used the apparatus shown.

A glass tube was sealed at one end. A plug of oil trapped a length / of air in the tube. The
water in the beaker was heated to a temperature @. The corresponding value of / was
measured. This was repeated for a range of temperatures.
The thermometer had a resolution of 0.5 °C. The scale had mm divisions.

The student's results are shown in the table.
The student plotted a graph of / against 9 as shown.

A student used a sonometer to investigate the properties of a stretched wire. The sonometer
is a long hollow wooden box.
A steel wire is attached to one end of the box and rests on two wooden bridges. The wire is

The student placed the base of a vibrating tuning fork in contact with the wire, at one of the
bridges. This set the wire into oscillation. He adjusted the position of the other bridge until a
single-loop standing wave was produced on the wire between the bridges.
The student repeated this for a series of tuning forks with different frequencies f. For each
fork he measured the distance L between the bridges.
The steel wire, of mass per unit length u, was placed under tension T by hanging a mass of
2.10 kg from the end of the wire.
(i) State one safety precaution that should be taken when carrying out the investigation.

Q29.
Read the passage and answer the question below.
Jy Reuiers:
The Solar Impulse 2 is a solar-powered plane that completed a round the world trip in 2016
without using fossil fuels.

The wings are covered in thin solar panels, keeping the total mass of the plane and pilot at
1600 kg. The need to reduce the weight limits the efficiency of the solar panels to 23%.
However, in daylight, these panels generate enough energy to run the four 7.5 kW electric
motors that keep the plane airborne and to fully charge the batteries that power the plane
during the night. The batteries take about 6 hours to fully charge.

In daylight the plane flies at a height of 8500 m to harness the most sunlight, and at night
descends to 1500 m. This descent makes use of the gravitational potential energy gained
during the day to help the plane get through the night.

The student concluded that her value for g was consistent with the accepted value.
Comment on the student's conclusion. Your answer should include a calculation of g from
the student's data.
You may assume that the percentage uncertainty in your value of g is the same as if the
value were calculated from just one pair of readings.

Q41.
A method to determine the wavelength of light using a converging lens was first proposed by
Sir Isaac Newton.
A converging lens is placed on a plane glass plate. The lens is illuminated from above with a
parallel beam of monochromatic light, as shown.
Some of the light is reflected from the upper surface of the lower glass plate and some from
the lower surface of the lens. Interference between these two reflected waves produces
circular fringes. The pattern is viewed through a microscope.

The diameter D of each circular fringe, numbered N from the centre, is measured using the
microscope. The data obtained from such an experiment is shown.

The relationship between WN and D is of the form D =pN*? where p and q are constants.
Determine p and q for this data using a graphical method. Use the additional columns for
your processed data.

A series of experiments was carried out in the 1970s to investigate the structure of protons
using the linac at Stanford, USA.
An electron leaves the accelerator with a momentum of 20 GeV /c.
(i) Explain, with reference to base units, why GeV / c can be used as a unit of momentum.
(2)
(ii) An electron with initial momentum 20 GeV / c collides with a stationary proton. After the
collision the electron is deflected by an angle of 20° as shown and its momentum is 9.1 GeV
/c. The momentum of the proton after the collision is 11.9 GeV/c.

Q45.
A student modelled the behaviour of a circuit containing a cell of emf 1.5 V with internal
resistance 3.0 Q, using a spreadsheet. In this model the cell is connected across a resistor.
The student used the model to investigate how the power P dissipated by the resistor varies
with its resistance R.

 Current A] P SW

The student concluded that the power dissipated by the resistor is a maximum when R is
between 2.5 QO and 3.5Q.

A teacher is demonstrating how to measure the speed of sound in a steel rod. The
equipment comprises a hanging steel rod and a hammer connected to a data logger as
shown.

The rod is tapped at A with the hammer. A compression pulse travels to B and is reflected
back. When the reflection reaches A the hammer loses contact with the rod.
Whilst the hammer is in contact with the rod the output from a 5 V supply is recorded by the
data logger.
