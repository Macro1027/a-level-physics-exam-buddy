(ref: Physics Review April 2015 p22)
The Charpy test is used by scientists to measure the fracture toughness of a material. A
simple pendulum, with a hammer on the end, is held high and released so that it swings
down and strikes the sample. The height from which the hammer is released is increased
until the sample fractures. Some energy is absorbed by the sample in the impact but the
hammer continues to move until it comes to rest at the top of its swing. Due to the law of
conservation of energy the hammer will not swing up as high as its starting position. The
difference in height between the start and end is proportional to the energy absorbed in the
impact — the fracture toughness.

Q32.
A teacher uses a linear air track to provide a frictionless surface for two gliders, each of
mass m. She uses this, with a pair of light gates connected to a computer, to investigate a
collision between the gliders.
The gliders are each given a small push and travel towards the centre of the track. The
gliders collide and move off together.

The computer displays the velocity of the gliders as they pass through the light gates.
Calculate the velocity of the gliders after the collision, using the principle of conservation of
linear momentum.
