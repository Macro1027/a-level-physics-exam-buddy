Q1.
Lighthouses are located along coastlines to aid navigation. A lighthouse emits an intense
beam of light. In clear weather the beam is visible for long distances, but in foggy weather
the visibility of the beam is limited.
The beam is refracted by water droplets in the air.
A light ray in the beam is incident on a spherical water droplet with an angle of incidence of
40.0°. The ray passes through the droplet and meets the water-air boundary at X as shown.

The power of the lens in the human eye changes as the lens changes shape. This enables a
person to see objects at different distances clearly. To change the shape, muscles in the eye
put the lens under stress.
A teacher was modelling the human eye. He placed an object 60 cm from a converging lens
system. A real image of the object was observed with a magnification of 0.5

The objective produces an image at P. This image becomes the object of the eyepiece,
which produces a final image at Q.
The eyepiece is at a distance of 100 mm from the image at P. To give a reasonable
magnification, the final image at Q should be a virtual image at a distance of 300 mm from
the eyepiece.

Q32.
The distance of the near point from the eye increases as people get older. Because of this,
older people use reading glasses to enable objects closer than the near point to be seen
clearly.
A person wants to buy reading glasses so that they can read text clearly at a distance of
27.5 cm from their eye. The minimum focal length for this person's eye is 1.93 cm and the
distance from the centre of the lens to the retina is 2.0 cm.
The available powers of lenses are +1.0 D, +1.5 D, +2.0 D, +2.5 D, +3.0 D and +3.5 D.
Show that the appropriate lens needed has a power of +2.0 D. You may ignore the distance
between the lens of the glasses and the eye.

A student carried out an experiment to determine the focal length of a converging lens.
He placed the lens a distance u from an illuminated object. He placed a screen on the other
side of the lens and moved the screen until a sharp image of the object was produced. He
measured the corresponding image distance v.
The student repeated the procedure for four more values of u.
In his lab report he wrote:
I made an initial determination of the focal length of the lens and
concluded that it was about 15cm. When [ plotted a graph it confirmed my
initial determination of the lens focal length."
The student's graph is shown.

Q52.
A simple optical fibre consists of a core surrounded by cladding. The refractive index of the
core is 1.56 and the refractive index of the cladding is 1.20.
(a) Show that the critical angle for light between these two media is about 50°.

(ob) The diagram shows a diverging beam of light incident on the boundary between the
core and the cladding. One side of the beam strikes the boundary at 60° and the other side
at 30° as shown.

Three students each suggest a different outcome for the beam of light at the boundary.
Student A says “all the beam will totally internally reflect".
Student B says “all the beam will refract".
Student C says "some of the beam will totally internally reflect and some will refract".
State which student is correct, adding to the diagram to illustrate your answer.

The analy comect answer is B because the power of a diverging lens                                             1
is negative, so the total power —=9.4D—-42 D=3.20D
Avs not correct because the total power should be obtamed from
(@4D—-42 Th), bout this is (940742 D)
IC is not comect because this is (4.2 D— 9.4 D) using negative power
tor a comversing lens and positive for a diverging lens where it
should be the apposite so that (9.4 D—4.2 D) is used
Dis net comect because — 13.6 D-—94D-42 DD asit both
lenses. are diverging, which 1s not the case

The only comect answer is B because at angles less than or equal to                                           1
the cnttcal angle not all of the light 1s reflected mmternally such that
angle of medence 1s equal te the angle of reflection
Ais not cocrect because total internal reflection occurs at angles
ereater than the cotical angle but at the critical angle the angle of
retraction is 90) degrees, so the reflection 1s mot total
IC is net comect because intemal reflection 1s mot total at angles less
than the critical angle
D is not coorect because internal reflection 1s not total at angles less
than the critical angle
