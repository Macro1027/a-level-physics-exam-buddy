A physics class made a toy rocket. A drinks bottle was partially filled with water and inverted
over a valve. An air pump delivered air to the bottle until the pressure forced the bottle from
the valve and the water was ejected from the bottle at high speed.

Q9g.
A motorist received a speeding penalty notice, from the police, for a short journey along 120
m of road.
(a) The car's specification states that the minimum time for the car to accelerate from 0 to
60 miles per hour is 9.5 seconds.
Show that the maximum value for the average acceleration of the car over 9.5 s is about
3ms*.
1 mile = 1600 m
(2)
(6) The police recorded a maximum speed for the car of 20 ms".
The motorist knows that the speed at the start and at the end of the 120 m journey was
zero.
Assume that the car had:
te)
constant positive acceleration, equal to the value in part (a), for the first 60 m of the
journey
te)
constant negative acceleration of the same magnitude for the final 60 m of the
journey.
Determine whether the motorist should challenge the penalty notice.

Q10.

A student carried out an experiment to determine the acceleration of free-fall g using the

apparatus shown in the photograph.

A ball bearing was released from a measured height h and a timer automatically started. On

hitting a timing plate, the ball bearing stopped the timer and the time t was displayed on the

timer. This was repeated for different values of h.

The uncertainty in t was + 3%. The uncertainty in h was + 1%.

The student concluded that her value for g was consistent with the accepted value.
Comment on the student's conclusion. Your answer should include a calculation of g from
the student's data.
You may assume that the percentage uncertainty in your value of g is the same as if the
value were calculated from just one pair of readings.

The world land speed record of 341 ms“! was set in October 1997. In an attempt to break
this record, a new supersonic car has been developed called the Bloodhound.
The developers of the Bloodhound have used computer modelling to produce a velocity-time

Q33.
A tennis player uses a racket to hit a ball over a net.
12m
The player stands 12 m from the net. He throws the ball vertically upwards and hits the ball
at a height of 2.5 m above the ground. The ball leaves the racket horizontally with a velocity
of 25 ms‘. The ball has a mass of 0.06 kg.
The ball must land within 6.1 m of the other side of the net.
Determine whether the ball hits the ground within this distance. Support your answer with a
calculation. Ignore the height of the net.

(i) Explain how the velocities have been calculated from the successive vertical positions of
the shuttlecock.

(2)
(ii) State why these velocities have been plotted at the mid-range of the time interval.

(1)
(iii) State, with a reason, two pieces of evidence from the graphs that show that the
shuttlecock does not follow the motion of a projectile moving freely under gravity.

(3)
(iv) Show, using the velocity-time graph, that the maximum height gained by the shuttlecock
is about 3 m.

The rock is held in a sling. When the peg is removed the counterweight falls and the rock is
projected through the air.
The rock was projected with a velocity of 41.5 ms"! at an angle of 30° to the horizontal. The
diagram shows the flight of the rock after it has left the trebuchet.
