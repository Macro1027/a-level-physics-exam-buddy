Q4.
A potential divider circuit may contain a component known as a potentiometer. One type of
potentiometer consists of a track with terminals X and Y at either end. There is a sliding
contact that can move along the track connected to a terminal Z as shown.
track                                                                                                                        end view of track

The length of the track is 115 mm and the width is 5.0 mm.
The resistance of the track between terminal X and terminal Y is 12.0 kQ.
Resistivity of track material = 0.49 O m
The potentiometer is used to monitor the displacement of a moving tool on a machine in a
production line. The tool is attached to the sliding contact. The potentiometer is connected
to a resistor of resistance R and a potential difference is applied as shown. The tool moves
through a maximum displacement of 60 mm from end X, producing a maximum potential
difference of 5.0 V between Z and X.

(ii) Calculate the value of R.
(3)
(iii) When the circuit is assembled, using the correctly calculated resistance value and a
battery of e.m.f. 12 V, it is found that the maximum output from the potentiometer is slightly
less than 5.0 V.
Explain why the maximum output is slightly less than predicted.

A student investigates the motion of a friction-free trolley down a ramp. On the top of the
trolley there is a metal loop which makes contact with a length of thin resistance wire, AB,
fixed above the ramp. The resistance wire has a uniform diameter.

(a) When a bulb is working normally its resistance is 8.0 Q. If the filament of the bulb
breaks, the lamp is designed to still conduct and its resistance becomes 3.0 Q.
(i) The filament of one bulb on a strand breaks.
By considering the effect this has on the remaining bulbs in that strand, explain why it is
recommended that broken bulbs are replaced as soon as possible.
(3)
(ii) The set of festive lights are fitted with a 3 A fuse. Five bulbs in one strand break.
Determine whether the fuse blows.

(b) A student investigates how the cross-sectional area of a fuse wire affects the current at
which the fuse blows. She uses pieces of wire of the same material and length, but different
cross-sectional areas. She steadily increases the current through each piece of wire and
records the maximum current through the wire before it breaks.

She then plots a graph of maximum current against cross-sectional area.

"Lockheed Martin Demonstrates Weapons Grade High Power Fiber Laser
BOTHELL, Wash., Jan. 28, 2014 — Lockheed Martin has demonstrated a 30-kilowatt electric
fiber laser, the highest power ever documented while retaining beam quality and electrical
efficiency.
The internally funded research and development program culminated in this demonstration,
which was achieved by combining many fiber lasers into a single, nearperfect quality beam
of light — all while using approximately 50 percent less electricity than alternative solid-state
laser technologies. The unique process, called Spectral Beam Combining, sends beams
from multiple fiber laser modules, each with a unique wavelength, into a combiner that forms
a single, powerful, high quality beam."

A solar panel uses electromagnetic radiation from the Sun to generate electricity.
In one installation a sensor in the solar panel measures the intensity of radiation arriving
from different directions. A motor rotates the solar panel so that it always faces the brightest
part of the sky.
The circuit diagram shows how a light dependent resistor (LDR) can be used to produce an
output potential difference (p.d.) that is dependent on the intensity of light. This output p.d. is
connected to a motor circuit that operates the movement of the solar panel.

Initially the motor is switched off. The light intensity increases and the resistance of the LDR
decreases to 750 Q.
The motor switches on when the output p.d. is above 13 V.
