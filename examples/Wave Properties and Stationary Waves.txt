Q2.
Two students are carrying out an investigation to determine a value for the speed of sound in
alr.
They stand 80 m from a building. One student hits two pieces of wood together to make a
loud sound and a short time later an echo is heard. The other student uses a stopwatch to
measure the time interval tf between the two pieces of wood being hit and the echo being
heard. The procedure is repeated. The students also measure the air temperature.

Spiders are almost completely dependent on vibrations transmitted through their web for
receiving information about the location of trapped insects. When the threads are disturbed
by the insects, progressive waves are transmitted along sections of the silk.
It has been suggested that the droplets of water collect at certain points on the web because
stationary waves are formed.
* Explain how stationary waves can be setup on a thread of spider silk, and how this can
account for the collection of water droplets at certain points on the thread.

Q28.
The diagram shows two identical pendulums, A and B, side by side with a rubber band
placed over both strings.
Pendulum A is displaced and starts to oscillate. As pendulum A oscillates, pendulum B starts
to oscillate with the same time period, its amplitude increasing as the amplitude of pendulum
A decreases. At one stage pendulum A is no longer oscillating and pendulum B has its
maximum amplitude. Then pendulum A starts to oscillate again with increasing amplitude, as
the amplitude of pendulum B decreases.
The apparatus is adjusted so that the pendulums do not have the same length as each
other. When the first pendulum is set into oscillation, the second pendulum starts to oscillate,
but with very small amplitude; the first pendulum does not stop oscillating.
The graph shows how the displacement of each pendulum varies with time at one stage in
the motion.

polarised.

o When there is no potential difference (p.d.) across the liquid crystal, the molecules in
the liquid crystal rotate the plane of polarisation by 90°.

o Light then passes through the upper polarising filter and appears on the screen.

o When a p.d. is applied across the liquid crystal, the molecules no longer rotate the
plane of polarisation. The light will not pass through the upper polarising filter and the

Q35.
Vibrations of a car engine cause a sound wave in air.
A silencer is a device fitted to a car to reduce the sound from the engine.
Some sound passes through the silencer chamber and is reflected twice. Some sound
passes straight through the chamber without being reflected.
The simplified diagram shows the paths of the sound as it travels through the chamber.
Sound leaving the chamber is a combination of sound waves from the two paths. The sound
waves are in phase as they enter the chamber.

The only correct answer is C because decreasing the mass on the
hanger decreases the tension m the strimg and, smce v= [—,
decreases the speed of waves on the strms. 4—w/f so the wavelength is
shorter and a whole wavelength could fit im the original length
Athe wavelength at the orginal frequency is unchanged, so decreasing
the leneth wall not allow a whole wavelength
B decreasing the frequency will mecrease the waveleneth, smce wave speed
is unchanged, so this will not allow a whole wavelength
Dsimce v = FE , decrease the mass per unit leneth will mcrease the wave speed,
increasing the wavelength at the original frequency, so this will not allow a
whole wavelength
